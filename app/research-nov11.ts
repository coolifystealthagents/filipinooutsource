The team writes the start event, the stop event, and the pause rule before collecting data. A count without a denominator cannot support a decision about staffing or quality. Filipino Outsource records the window and every exclusion beside the extract. A written rule is easier to audit than a habit that lives with one supervisor.",

        "heading": "Question and scope",
        "paragraphs": [
          "This protocol asks what the process migration readiness record can show about evidence, timing, and closure in one Filipino offshore team. It is a local measurement method, not an industry benchmark or an audit opinion. The result describes one defined population during one observation window. Filipino Outsource uses it to make a review reproducible rather than to score a person. The same evidence standard should apply to the easiest queue and the most sensitive one.",
          "The scope covers migration steps prepared during the observation window, not every task in the account. The team writes the start event, the stop event, and the pause rule before collecting data. A count without a denominator cannot support a decision about staffing or quality. Filipino Outsource records the window and every exclusion beside the extract. That discipline keeps a local review from turning into a general claim about Filipino teams.",
          "A reader should be able to tell which questions the protocol answers and which it leaves open. Filipino Outsource writes those boundaries before the first case is selected. A method that promises more than the record can support will be ignored after the first disagreement. The scope note is part of the result. The owner should keep the extract and the finding together so a later reviewer can repeat the work."

      },
      {
        "heading": "Population and unit of analysis",
        "paragraphs": [
          "The unit is one process step moved to a new client tool. Test the definition on a case that crosses owners, a case that is still open, and a case that was reopened after a correction. Apply the same rule to every case and keep the rule beside the extract. A definition that changes halfway through the window destroys comparability. That discipline keeps a local review from turning into a general claim about Filipino teams.",
          "The population is migration steps prepared during the observation window. The primary measure is the share practiced with access and a rollback path. Add a count of cases with missing evidence and the median age of items still open at cutoff. Report each measure with its denominator, observation window, and exclusion count. The owner should keep the extract and the finding together so a later reviewer can repeat the work.",
          "The population should be frozen before the first case is scored. Filipino Outsource records the extract date, the source system, and the filter used to build the list. A population that grows during the review changes the denominator without warning. That change would make the result impossible to compare. A written rule is easier to audit than a habit that lives with one supervisor."

      {
        "heading": "Definitions and measures",
        "paragraphs": [
          "Define completion before the first case is selected. For this protocol, completion means the record supports the measure with a dated source and a named reviewer. A case that fails the definition stays open even when a status field says closed. Filipino Outsource records the status field and the evidence separately so the gap remains visible. The owner should keep the extract and the finding together so a later reviewer can repeat the work.",
          "Each case needs a source, an observation time, the field it supports, and the reviewer who checked it. Mark missing, unavailable, and confirmed negative values as separate states. Collapsing them hides the difference between no evidence and evidence of absence. The codebook names the allowed values before collection begins. A written rule is easier to audit than a habit that lives with one supervisor.",
          "A completion definition should separate evidence of work from evidence of outcome. Filipino Outsource asks whether the destination record changed, not only whether a task was marked done. The same definition should apply to every case in the window. A definition that shifts for difficult cases destroys trust in the finding. The review should name the person who can change the process, not only the person who collects the data."

        "paragraphs": [
          "Use a random or systematic start rule, then take consecutive cases inside each risk group. Stratify by client, owner, and channel so the sample is not dominated by the easiest queue. Include at least one adverse case such as a missing source or a conflicting record. Filipino Outsource records every access failure instead of replacing it silently. A written rule is easier to audit than a habit that lives with one supervisor.",
          "The evidence standard for process migration readiness should be written before the sample is drawn. A reviewer needs to know which source counts, what date is attached, and how a missing field is treated. Filipino Outsource keeps a short codebook beside the extract so the rule does not live in one person's memory. The codebook is part of the method, not an afterthought. The review should name the person who can change the process, not only the person who collects the data.",
          "The reviewer should record the source that was unavailable as well as the source that was checked. Filipino Outsource keeps a short note for each access failure so the gap is visible. A clean sample built by skipping hard cases is not evidence of a clean process. The sampling rule should say what happens when a case cannot be scored. A small sample is still useful when the exclusions and the observation window are visible."

          "Sample across the full observation window, including busy days and days when coverage changed. A sample drawn only from quiet days can make a fragile process look stable. Record the date, time, and owner for each observation. If the population is small, report the count and the instability instead of a precise-looking rate. The review should name the person who can change the process, not only the person who collects the data.",
          "Collection ends when the planned sample is complete and the codebook is attached. Do not add cases after the result is known, and do not remove a difficult case to make the rate cleaner. A second reviewer should be able to rerun the extract from the written rule. Filipino Outsource stores the extract, the codebook, and the finding together. A small sample is still useful when the exclusions and the observation window are visible.",
          "The collection log should show who pulled the sample, when, and from which system. Filipino Outsource keeps that log beside the extract so a second reviewer can repeat the work. A sample that cannot be reproduced is only an anecdote. The log also makes later changes in the population visible. The team should record what it could not inspect instead of assuming the missing record was fine."

        "paragraphs": [
          "The main limit is that the process migration readiness record may be incomplete, delayed, or kept outside the team. This method cannot infer missing work from a clean summary. It also cannot establish whether a policy was followed in cases that left no trace. Filipino Outsource states those limits before presenting the result. A small sample is still useful when the exclusions and the observation window are visible.",
          "Show the distribution, not only the mean. A median close time can hide a long tail of cases that nobody reviews. Report the open-case count and the oldest case age by owner. That view shows where delay accumulates and which queue needs a process change. The team should record what it could not inspect instead of assuming the missing record was fine.",
          "A local result should not be presented as a forecast for another client or another team. Filipino Outsource labels the finding with the population, the window, and the evidence standard used. The report should name the conditions that would make the result stale. That honesty keeps the review useful after the workflow changes. A result that cannot survive a second reviewer is not ready to guide a client conversation."

          "The report ends with one next action: fix the source, simplify the field, change the queue, or stop the work until the owner decides. Give the change an owner and a check date. Filipino Outsource repeats the protocol after the change and compares the same definitions. The next sample uses the same codebook and population rule. The team should record what it could not inspect instead of assuming the missing record was fine.",
          "Report what moved, what did not, and what remains unknown. That final sentence is the honest close of a measurement protocol. It is more useful than a precise-looking rate built on an unclear denominator. The goal is a reviewable decision, not a perfect number. A result that cannot survive a second reviewer is not ready to guide a client conversation.",
          "The next action should be small enough to finish before the next review. Filipino Outsource asks for one change, one owner, and one check date rather than a broad improvement plan. The team should record what it expects the change to affect. A later sample can then test that expectation directly. The same evidence standard should apply to the easiest queue and the most sensitive one."

        "paragraphs": [
          "Repeat the protocol after the workflow changes and keep the old and new rules side by side for one transition window. Label which rule applies to each case so the comparison remains honest. Filipino Outsource compares the same measures and the same exclusions. A change in systems, policy, or client mix is recorded as a new baseline. A result that cannot survive a second reviewer is not ready to guide a client conversation.",
          "A review that ends with general encouragement will not change the queue. Filipino Outsource asks for one named process change, one owner, and one check date. The next sample tests whether the change held under ordinary volume. If the evidence does not support the change, the team records the gap and narrows the claim. The same evidence standard should apply to the easiest queue and the most sensitive one.",
          "The transition period deserves its own note because old and new rules can both appear in the same week. Filipino Outsource labels each case with the rule version that applied when it was handled. That label prevents a false comparison between two different processes. The next review can then decide whether the new rule should continue. That discipline keeps a local review from turning into a general claim about Filipino teams."
